- GitHub Actions workflow execution
- Automated deployment to development and production
- Zero-downtime updates
- Automatic backup creation
- Health checks and monitoring

## Installation

1. Get the app:
    ```bash
    cd ~/frappe-bench/apps
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/erpnext-petcare.git
    ```

2. Install the app on your site:
    ```bash
    bench --site yoursite install-app erpnext_petcare
    ```

3. Run migrations:
    ```bash
    bench --site yoursite migrate
    ```

## Development Workflow

We follow a `dev ‚Üí main ‚Üí production` workflow:

- **Development happens on** the `dev` branch, deployed to: [dev.masterpet.co.in](https://dev.masterpet.co.in)
- Once changes are tested and stable, they are merged into `main`
- **Production pulls only from** the `main` branch and is deployed to: [erp.masterpet.co.in](https://erp.masterpet.co.in)

### Steps:

1. **On dev server:**
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    # Make changes
    bench --site dev.masterpet.co.in migrate
    bench restart
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your changes"
    git push origin dev
    ```

2. **To push to production:**
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge dev
    git push origin main
    ```

3. **On prod server:**
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    bench --site erp.masterpet.co.in migrate
    bench restart
    ```

### Updating Fields or Doctypes?

If you create or modify custom fields, Property Setters, or Doctypes in the dev site (`dev.masterpet.co.in`), you should export them so they can be version-controlled and applied on production.

1. **Export the changes as fixtures** (on dev):
    ```bash
    bench --site dev.masterpet.co.in export-fixtures --app erpnext_petcare
    ```

2. **Commit and push to the `dev` branch**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Exported updated fixtures"
    git push origin dev
    ```

3. **Merge to `main` when tested**:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge dev
    git push origin main
    ```

4. **On production (`erp.masterpet.co.in`), pull and migrate**:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    bench --site erp.masterpet.co.in migrate
    bench restart
    ```

### Using `bench console` (Which Site?)

By default, running:

```bash
bench console
```
will open the console for the site defined in sites/common_site_config.json

To check which site you're in from inside the console:
```bash
frappe.local.site
```
This will return the active site name, like 'erp.masterpet.co.in' or 'dev.masterpet.co.in'.

‚úÖ Best Practice
Always specify the site explicitly to avoid mistakes:

```bash
bench --site dev.masterpet.co.in console
bench --site erp.masterpet.co.in console
```

## Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)

Our project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployments to both development and production environments.

### üöÄ Automated Deployment Flow

- **Development Branch (`dev`)**: 
  - Automatically deploys to [dev.masterpet.co.in](https://dev.masterpet.co.in)
  - Triggered on every push to the `dev` branch

- **Production Branch (`main`)**: 
  - Automatically deploys to [erp.masterpet.co.in](https://erp.masterpet.co.in)
  - Triggered on every push to the `main` branch

### üîß How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Located in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Uses `appleboy/ssh-action` for secure SSH deployment
   - Triggers automatically on code pushes

2. **Server-Side Deployment Script**
   - Located at `~/frappe-bench/deploy.sh`
   - Handles the following tasks:
     - Pulls latest code from GitHub
     - Runs bench migrate and clears cache
     - Restarts necessary ERPNext services
     - Performs health checks
     - Logs all actions to deploy.log
     - Creates automatic backups before changes

3. **Security**
   - Passwordless automation using SSH keys
   - Configured sudoers for necessary commands
   - Secure handling of sensitive operations

### üìù Deployment Logs

All deployment activities are logged to `~/frappe-bench/deploy.log` for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Usage

- Access pet care features from the ERPNext desk after installation.
- Configure scheduled jobs and integrations as needed.

## Development
